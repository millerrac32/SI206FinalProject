delete a file called "line.txt" from the SI206FinalProject directory
Run "python3 weather.py" exactly 4 times
Change directory to "populationAPI" on the terminal
run "python3 pop.py" on the terminal multiple times until it has inserted 250 rows into the database. It will print messages to tell you when its done.
