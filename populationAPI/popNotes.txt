Countrylayer API Documentation
The countrylayer service provides common information about countries via a REST API. With this API, users will be able to get detailed information about countries in the world. Because they can filter by name of a country, language, code, currency, the capital city, calling code, region, or regional bloc.

In this document, you will find out about the API structure, the methods, potential errors you may encounter, and code examples. If you still have questions and doubts, please do not hesitate to contact us. Our team will do their best to help you.

API Key
The API has a unique identifier as an API key that gets passed into the API as an URL parameter access_key. This parameter serves as a unique identifying authentication with the countrylayer API.

Base URL:

https://api.countrylayer.com/v2/
Append your API Key: See an example of how to authenticate the countrylayer API with the access_key parameter:

https://api.countrylayer.com/v2/all
    ? access_key = API_KEY
API Response
The data is returned in a standard JSON format and easily parsed in any programming language.

Example Response: See below an example of an API response that provides information about all world countries.
